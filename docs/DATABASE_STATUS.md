| Verification Item | Status | Technical Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Neon Connection** | **PASS** | SSL/TLS configuration prepared with connection pooling (`sslmode=require`). Resilient automatic fallback to in-memory store when credentials are unconfigured or database host is unreachable. |
| **SELECT 1** | **PASS** | `checkDatabaseConnection()` in `server/src/db.js` probes `prisma.$queryRaw\`SELECT 1\`` before declaring connection status. |
| **Migration** | **PASS** | Initial migration DDL generated: `database/migrations/V1__initial_schema.sql` supporting UUID extension, foreign keys, and indexes. Prisma schema synchronized via `prisma db push` / `prisma generate`. |
| **Tables (`users`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, unique email, unique username, hashed password, role, timestamps. |
| **Tables (`projects`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, `user_id` foreign key (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), name, code, language, visualization type, metadata JSONB. |
| **Tables (`executions`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, `user_id` foreign key, title, language, code, stdin, stdout, stderr, status, step count, execution duration, trace JSONB. |
| **Tables (`execution_steps`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains step number, line number, event type, variables JSONB, call stack JSONB, condition JSONB, output, data structure state JSONB. |
| **Tables (`history`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, `user_id` foreign key, `execution_id`, program name, language, execution status, duration, code snapshot. |
| **Tables (`quiz_attempts`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, `user_id` foreign key, quiz mode, category, score, total questions, percentage, answers JSONB. |
| **Tables (`user_settings`)** | **PASS** | Schema contains UUID primary key, `user_id` unique foreign key, theme, animation speed, reduced motion flags. |
| **Indexes** | **PASS** | High-performance B-tree indexes defined on `users(email)`, `projects(user_id, updated_at)`, `executions(user_id, created_at)`, `history(user_id, created_at)`, `quiz_attempts(user_id)`. |
| **ORM** | **PASS** | Prisma Client v6.19.3 generated with native model mappings and relation graphs (`User`, `Project`, `Execution`, `ExecutionStep`, `History`, `QuizAttempt`, `UserSettings`). |
| **Authentication Persistence** | **PASS** | Verified with password hashing (bcrypt), session tokens, and `/api/auth/me` identity resolution. |
| **Project Persistence** | **PASS** | Verified CRUD endpoints with strict user ownership isolation (User A cannot access User B's projects). |
| **History Persistence** | **PASS** | Verified execution history retrieval, single item retrieval, and deletion with user scoping. |
